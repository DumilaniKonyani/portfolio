# 👋 Dumilani Konyani

Hey there! I'm Dumilani — a curious tech explorer from Malawi 🇲🇼  
I enjoy helping people fix tech issues, exploring new tools, and experimenting with code (even when I don’t call myself a full-on coder yet).

## 🧠 What I’m Into
- 🖥️ Tech support & systems
- 💻 Light coding (HTML, CSS, a bit of Python)
- 🎶 French music & culture
- 🌶️ Cooking & spicy experiments (ask about my homemade chilli)
- 🌍 Exploring new places
- 😴 Taking the perfect nap 😄

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Building small fun projects to learn
- Creating a personal landing page (like this one!)
- Learning to push code confidently on GitHub
